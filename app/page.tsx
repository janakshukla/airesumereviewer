    strengths: [
      "Strong project portfolio showcasing a variety of skills and technologies.",
      "Inclusion of live demos for most projects (great for demonstrating abilities).",
      "Good academic record with high percentages and CGPA.",
      "Clear presentation of skills and projects.",
      "Use of Github for project hosting.",

      "Standardize project date formatting (e.g., MM/YYYY or YYYY-MM).",
      'Elaborate on "Data Structures 1" and include other relevant concepts (algorithms, databases, etc.).',
      "Organize the skills section logically (e.g., group by category).  Consider using a skills matrix or bar chart.",
      "Rearrange contact information for better readability (e.g., Name, Email, Phone, Location, Links).",
      "Add a section on relevant coursework (if applicable) to further showcase skills.",
      "Add a section on awards, honors, or relevant extracurricular activities.",

    otherFeedback:
      "While Janak has impressive projects, the resume needs improvements to effectively communicate his value to potential employers.  The lack of a strong summary and detailed project descriptions are major weaknesses.  Focusing on the impact of his projects, rather than just listing features, will significantly improve the resume.",
